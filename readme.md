<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

In 2025, the U.S. government dismantled a federal agency that was responsible for nearly 50% of the world’s humanitarian aid. That agency, USAID (U.S. Agency for International Development), had long been the largest global donor of humanitarian assistance, contributing billions of dollars each year to development efforts in sectors such as health, defense, and the economy.

This dashboard focuses on USAID's health sector funding in Asia over a 10-year span (2011 to 2021). It also presents social development indicators for the countries that received this aid. Key trends highlighted in the dashboard include:
- Across the 2011-2021 period, women in recipient countries earned, on average, only about 50% of what men earned. (GNP per capita)
- From 2011 to 2021, there was a gradual decline in funding, interrupted only by a temporary rebound in 2017
- Although Afghanistan was the top recipient of funding during the period, its development indicators remain the poorest among all beneficiary countries, with particularly low life expectancy and the highest maternal mortality rate.



### Built With

The dashboard was fully created thanks to Microsoft Power BI Desktop. The canvas was made with Powerpoint, I saved the powerpoint slide an image ".svg" to be then uploaded in the background of the dashboard.

<!-- GETTING STARTED -->
## Getting Started

The most important is to download all csv files in a specific location (local or hosted online), then in the power query go to Source settings of each file and change the source to your new location of file.

### Prerequisites

To use the dashboard, Microsoft Power BI Desktop must be installed on your computer.


<!-- USAGE EXAMPLES -->
## Usage

The dashboard can be used to report fundings and social development indicators from other regions. To do so, go to "Transform data" and for each table change the filtered row step to change the filter to the continent wanted.
